            <h3>My Mission</h3>
            <p>Some of the best memories from my childhood were made at a salon. Since I was 10 years old, the only time I ever went to the salon was on my birthday because it was so expensive. But it was magical. As a little girl, I felt so much more confident and powerful with a cute set of nails than I would have without it. Oddly enough so did most of my friends. I went for one year with my aunt Donna, who I have always looked up to. She is a very successful woman and does very well in her STEM career. She always had her nails and hair done nicely, and for some reason my young mind related that to her success. But in my defense, I feel a lot more motivated when I have my nails done too. My goal is to make getting your nails done not such a rare and expensive experience. I feel like every girl should have the chance to get their nails done and feel powerful. Because of this, I offer various forms of payment. You can pay upfront, donate supplies, or trade in something of similar value. I am always open to negotiation as well. The main purpose is to make it so everyone can get their nails done!  </p>

            <p>Hi! My name is Bri Christiansen. I am 21 years old, studying web design and development at Brigham Young University – Idaho. I started college as a vocal performance major and loved every second of it. I just did not feel challenged enough and wanted to pursue something I could be more successful in. I eventually decided on data science because math is a major passion of mine. I quickly learned that as a data science major, it is a lot less math, and a lot more coding than I would have liked. I wanted something a little more creative, but related enough to data science that I didn’t lose so many credits, and that is when I discovered web design and development.
                I grew up in Hillsboro Oregon and lived there until I was 14. Then we moved to Chandler Arizona. Growing up, I loved all things creative. I was always either outside painting, doing sidewalk chalk, making bracelets, or inside writing music, doing my nails, or learning new instruments. Something different about me is I am autistic, and many of my special interests involved something creative or mathematical like memorizing digits of pi. But one of the things I loved the most was doing nails. I did my first set of nails when I was 13. It turned out horrible, which in a way motivated me even more. I kept trying and practicing for years, until I could consistently do my nails to where I liked it. After reaching this goal, I have made it a new goal of mine to learn how to do other people’s nails. It is something that brings me so much joy and happiness to do a good job, and make someone else feel pampered. </p>
