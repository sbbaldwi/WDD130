      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My purpose is to make getting your nails done easy and affordable. My business is different than most as I offer many options for payment, and have much lower prices than salons in the area. You can donate supplies as a form of payment, you can pay over time, or you can pay upfront. Either way my prices are low to start. I want to break the cycle of self care being a luxury. Everyone deserves to be spoiled and pampered. </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience is women in the Rexburg area who are wanting to get their nails done without spending a lot of money. </p>  <!-- change this -->

        Some of the best memories from my childhood were made at a salon. Since I was 10 years old, the only time I ever went to the salon was on my birthday because it was so expensive. But it was magical. As a little girl, I felt so much more confident and powerful with a cute set of nails than I would have without it. Oddly enough so did most of my friends. I went for one year with my aunt Donna, who I have always looked up to. She is a very successful woman and does very well in her STEM career. She always had her nails and hair done nicely, and for some reason my young mind related that to her success. But in my defense, I feel a lot more motivated when I have my nails done too. My goal is to make getting your nails done not such a rare and expensive experience. I feel like every girl should have the chance to get their nails done and feel powerful. Because of this, I offer various forms of payment. You can pay upfront, donate supplies, or trade in something of similar value. I am always open to negotiation as well. The main purpose is to make it so everyone can get their nails done!

      <h5>About</h5>
      <p>
        Hi! My name is Bri Christiansen. I am 21 years old, studying web design and development at Brigham Young University – Idaho. I started college as a vocal performance major and loved every second of it. I just did not feel challenged enough and wanted to pursue something I could be more successful in. I eventually decided on data science because math is a major passion of mine. I quickly learned that as a data science major, it is a lot less math, and a lot more coding than I would have liked. I wanted something a little more creative, but related enough to data science that I didn’t lose so many credits, and that is when I discovered web design and development.
 I grew up in Hillsboro Oregon and lived there until I was 14. Then we moved to Chandler Arizona. Growing up, I loved all things creative. I was always either outside painting, doing sidewalk chalk, making bracelets, or inside writing music, doing my nails, or learning new instruments. Something different about me is I am autistic, and many of my special interests involved something creative or mathematical like memorizing digits of pi. But one of the things I loved the most was doing nails. I did my first set of nails when I was 13. It turned out horrible, which in a way motivated me even more. I kept trying and practicing for years, until I could consistently do my nails to where I liked it. After reaching this goal, I have made it a new goal of mine to learn how to do other people’s nails. It is something that brings me so much joy and happiness to do a good job, and make someone else feel pampered.

        The cool thing about my business is you get to help me help you. I have been doing nails for 7 years but have only done nails on other people a few times. I get practice in, while you get your nails done. It's a win win!

        Logo will be in the left corner of the nav bar. The nav bar will stretch across the whole website. At the bottom I will have a link to my instagram account for Rexburg Nail Lady. I already have the icon in my siteplan and the account linked. I have 2 other pages, one for my work, and a contact form. I have an image for each page where if you click on it it will send yu to that page, as well as a nav bar that will also show the other pages.
